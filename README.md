## Caveat emptor
The bookmarklet transfers the password and stores it in the bookmarks storage **unencrypted**! On other hand, the bookmarklet creator prevents you from using an unencrypted connection.

Nevertheless, do not use it either on a computer or with a connection you do not trust! **You have been warned**.
